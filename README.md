# AgentBasedModeling

Sensitivity analysis:
Input variables:
- Agent level:
	- memory
	- strategy evaluation memory
	- number of strategies
	- positivity
	- "strategy category"
		- Prioritize Past vs Present
		- Single vs many
- Market level:
	- memory of all agents
	- percentage random agents

Output variables:
- Agent level:
	- profit
		- individual
		- average
		- of all agents
		- of non-random agents
	- number of matches
- Market level:
	- stability
		- variance / standard deviation

Experiments:
- Memory vs Profit (agent level)
- Strategy evaluation memory vs Profit (agent level)
- Memory vs Match number (agent level)
- Strategy evaluation memory vs Match number (agent level)
- Feed in real market data --> So how our market deviates
- Seed different markets to check how agents perform in them



Curent ideas and To-Dos:
Have a look at exponential growth
--> until match up work
-->  until strategies work
- several strategies
- select best (Maybe Westerhoff)
	- comparing older results
	- memory...
- price adjusted (Maybe Westerhoff as well)
- volatitlity clustering?
- strategies adapted for information arrival/speed of price adjustment
- influence of memory on market
- influence of market on strategy/memory (if some eovlution)
- check stability,, total sales, price change...


The stock market (El Farol = bar example)

Steps for the (artificial) stock market: 
1. Building the simplest version of the minority game - binary: yes/no 
  In every round the agents decides whether to buy or sell
  Class: Model: Time, List of agent, Whether agent wins/loses
  Class: Agent: Saves own score, History of own choices
2. Extend this to the agents: the amount of money they have
3. Connect buyer and seller (Order sale price list or randomize sale list and pick random?)
4. Estimation of the price --> sell or won't sell
  e.g. lowest sale price in previous round - won't sell
5. Strategies of the agents: ('hard part')
  e.g. fixed strategies (always being possitive/negative about the market)
  e.g. above amount of money: sell, below amount of money: buy
  e.g. Group of agents: Always overbuy, always oversell
  e.g. Group of agents: Negative buyers, positive sellers
6. Statistics: 
  e.g. min/max/average price --> based on this agent make new decision 
  e.g. Volumes/ how many units (amount of money)
7. Model Gini coefficient (measure of wealth inequality) 

Multiple ideas: 
- Introduce mutations
- Learning: Adapt neighbors --> number of strategies stays fixed --> random chance of adapting
- Reenforcement learning/Neural agent: copying strategy of other agents 
- Shill (happens with bitcoins) --> pump and dump
- El farol with coefficients - to decide the price (current price and difference of average of N last weeks) 
(Looking at own OR sharing strategies of agents: -force it- to copy strategy)  
- Netlogo: Social science --> Bidding market, El Farol, Minority game, Oil kartel hubnet

MIKE: Work backwards: What is the research question (possible experiments or hypothesis -- before you code)

Research questions:
- How much influence is needed to stirr the market?
- Are certain markets (many well-behaved, many crazy traders) more easily stirred?
- Is the market more stable with a heterogeneous or a homogeneous set of traders?
- Do traders with certain strategies prefer traders with certain other strategies?
- What is the best strategy for a trader?
- Which strategies will lead to a stable market?

instruction for sensitivity analysis:
so here is the instruction for running sa after pulling the most recent version:
in the file sensitivityanalysis.py, on line 29 it says 'sadata/samples_nathalie.csv', and on line 44 it says 'sadata/outcomes_nathalie.csv', in both lines replace my name with your own name and run the file sensitivity analysis. wait for it to finish and push your results. Easy peasy.
the only requirement is that i need to have created a samples_yourname.csv file with your input variables.
