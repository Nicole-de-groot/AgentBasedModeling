# AgentBasedModeling

Ideas: \n
Stock market 
- minority game
- artificial stock market
- El Farol = bar example 
- Search model on
- Agents: amount of money they have 

Steps for the stock market: 
1. Making the minority game - binary: yes/no
2. Every round agent desides whether they buy or sell
3. Estimate the price - lowest sale price in previous round - wont sell
4. set of standard agents -- fixed strategies (always +/- about market) 
5. order sale price list or randomize sale list and pick random
Statistics: max/min and average price --> based on this agents make decision on new round 
Statistics: Volumes
Hard part: strategies 

El farol with cooefficients - to decide the price (current price and difference of average of N last weeks) 
(Looking at own OR sharing strategies of agents: -force it- to copy strategy) 
add learning - neural agent - reenforcement learning -- copying strategy of other agents 

Work on backwards: What is the research question 
- possible experiments or hypothesis -- before you code
